GUIDE TO THE FOLDERS
-app has the folders for the models, and folder for the controller
-db is where out database will be created, and we'll keep migrations files in the migrations folder
-lib is for data (i think?) so anything that has the actual student data, like a seeder file or CSV
-tests in spec

----rake has a console method, as we add models we can add them after the "-r" so we can launch our irb environment
